  <div>avaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
  interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic,
   weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of
 the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is
  an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and
  all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
